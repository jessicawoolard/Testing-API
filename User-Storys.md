As a user:
I want to be able to set up and make an account/log in
I want to be able to create a profile for my pet/myself
I want to be able to create a special QR code to link straight to my pet’s profile
I want to be able to tag my pet as lost and send out email to existing users within a certain radius.
I want to be able to get a notification when my pet’s QR code has been scanned
I want to be able to get a text message from the application when someone finds my pet so I don’t have to provide my personal phone number.


As a person who finds a lost animal:
I want to be able to scan the QR code and it take me straight to the pets profile 
I want to be able to contact owner if pet is missing
I want to be able to communicate with the owner of the missing animal without providing my person information with the pet owner.
