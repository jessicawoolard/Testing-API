I have an inside/outside cat named Sponge that frequently prowls outside. I wanted a way for someone finding him to know that he was not lost, just exploring. I have created an application that will let a pet owner create a webpage for their pet with name, information, pictures and general home location. The pet’s collar could be fitted with a QR code tag, that when scanned would immediately load the pet’s webpage.
